flask-htmx-test
===============

A simple webapp to try out htmx.

The code is contained in a single Python file containing the HTML template using only CDN resources.

It renders an example plot with matplotlib, and provides a form to change the plot parameters.

Does it all in under 100 lines of code.

ngl, I'm impressed.
